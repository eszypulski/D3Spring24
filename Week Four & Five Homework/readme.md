I decided to do a bar chart showing the number of pictures I have in iCloud of various friends/family/cats. My son, who is only 15 months old, beat everyone by a few thousand. I would have liked to add data labels to the bars in order to really drive this home, but I couldn't figure it out.

I also am curious about how I could use CSS to select all the elements. The SVG text at the top picked up the italics I applied, but not a (hideous) blue color I tried and ditched.
