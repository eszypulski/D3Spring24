## Very Belated Homework 3

Thank you for your understanding as I dug myself out of the pit of toddler illness + a week of 2-3 hours of sleep a night (data that's too depressing to visualize, to be honest).

### What is this?
For this assignment, I visualized how the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food here in the US has risen and fallen (mainly risen) over the years. I got my data from [The USDA, via data.gov](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook.aspx) I worked a lot off of the code you provided, but also the d3 documentation, my own knowledge of CSS (the fun part), and [a blog post I read on placing text on a path](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/2015/09/placing-text-on-arcs/), which was not actually the right solution but the only solution I could figure out.

### Things that could work a lot better
- Axis labels! I still can't wrap my head around how to specify where that text should go. I tried and failed to learn from some examples and discussions I found on Stack Exchange.
- The line label that barely works but really doesn't (hence why I only labeled one line).
- The method of presenting the data. I think that a line chart is actually the wrong choice for this data because it is misleading - if you were to glance, you would think that food prices were going up and down by that much, but some of the downward movements still represent a percent increase! 
- A few visual nuances - I'd love to add another horizontal line (and maybe fill) to mark where the numbers go into the negatives.
